  <h2>Brainstorming:</h2>
  <p>Several ideas and themes were brought up when it came to coming up with an idea for this project.
    Themes such as the metamorphosis of a butterfly were one of them and also the timeline of the endangerment of
    tigers. I originally thought of those two ideas in the beginning because I believed that the metamorphosis process
    would be a good narrative. My interest and love for tigers was the reason for my second idea. But in the end I
    ended up doing neither of the two original concepts and came up with skydiving. The idea came while playing a videogame
    called Fortnite, a third-person shooter game that has become highly popular in the past few months. The games starts off
    with the player's avatar skydiving after jumping off the plane and dropping at a certain area in the map and the end goal
    is to win against 99 other players that are present in the server. And thus my theme was finalized.
  </p>

  <h2>Storyboarding:</h2>
  <p>My final site ended up the same as my first storyboard sketches that consisted of 5 frames. Not a lot of changes
     were made besides some illustrations. The first frame consisted of the title and the plane that the skydiver would
     drop out off. As the user scrolls down the page different facts or narrative material are supposed to pop out. As the
     diver gets closer to the ground eventually the parachute would deploy and the diver would land safely and that would
     show the end of the website.
   </p>
   <h2>Challenges:</h2>
   <h3>Challenge 1 : Code</h3>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>Playing around with the different codes that were taught to us in class helped in the creation of this webpage.
      The basic long scroll that was created in class became the skeleton of the long scrolling page. The animations in the
      page were achieved with keyframes in css and the long scroll was created in javascript. </p>
    <h3>Challenge 2 : Art style</h3>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>Coming up with an art style for this project took long than it should. I debated between a realistic depiction
      of the narrative by using stock photos or illustrating them myself in illustrator, in the end i decided on the latter.
      I used a flat art style in the illustrations, drawing is not my strongest point but by using a flat style I can create
      the images fully in illustrator and using tools that i'm already familiar with, such as the pen tool and basic shapes. I
      also went to different websites to come up with the right color palette and find the range of colors that would work with the
      style that I'm going to be working with. </p>
    <h3>Challenge 3 : Skydiver (ongoing)</h3>
    <h3><s>Solution</s></h3>
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>I ended up with a website that I'm pretty satisfied with and I believe that at this point in my academic career this is something
      that  would be more than happy to turn in. This project made me think outside of the box when it came to figuring out the different
      codes that would go together in order for it to work. It's still an ongoing project that I would very much like to
      expand and hopefully improve in the future. </p>
